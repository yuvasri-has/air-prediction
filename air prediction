Air prediction refers to the process of forecasting the quality and composition of the air in a specific area over a given period. This involves analyzing various environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, wind patterns, and pollution levels, to predict changes in air quality. Air prediction models use data from weather stations, satellites, and sensors to estimate concentrations of pollutants like particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3). These predictions are essential for public health, allowing people to take precautions during high pollution events, and for policymakers to make informed decisions about environmental regulations.
